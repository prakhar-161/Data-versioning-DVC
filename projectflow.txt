1. code.py file saves a csv file to a new "data" folder
# pip install dvc
2. dvc init (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
3. "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
4. "dvc add data/" - makes data.dvc and changes in .gitignore
    - Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    - Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
